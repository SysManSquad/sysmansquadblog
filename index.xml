We&amp;rsquo;re now going to move on to the actual effort it takes to build your lab. As you recall we got pretty far last time in documenting the beginnings of our network. For this lab I&amp;rsquo;ll be using VMWare Workstation, but you can accomplish this with Microsoft Hyper-V, Oracle VirtualBox, the free tier of VMWare&amp;rsquo;s ESX, or XCP-NG.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the previous post, please have a look here as each post builds upon the last.</description></item><item><title>Windows Virtual Desktop: Creation and Management</title><link>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2021/01/13/wvd-creation-and-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2020 06:33:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2021/01/13/wvd-creation-and-management/</guid><description>THIS GUIDE IS NOW OUTDATED WITH THE RELEASE OF WVD 2.0, I will create a new blog with the updated info in the future! Some of the info below is still valid! Why Windows Virtual Desktop? Windows Virtual Desktop allows you to create virtual Windows 10 machines that can be accessed from virtually anywhere. This means you can give someone a full desktop experience from virtually anywhere including android and iOS!</description></item><item><title>Reprovision Windows 10 Apps… Wait, What?</title><link>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2021/01/06/reprovision-windows-10-apps-wait-what/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2020 13:54:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2021/01/06/reprovision-windows-10-apps-wait-what/</guid><description>Remember when we all complained that Microsoft &amp;ldquo;wasn&amp;rsquo;t respecting our app removals!&amp;rdquo; and they were all reinstalled during every feature update? Pepperidge farm remembers. Well, Microsoft was kind enough to hear our collective complaints, and take action on them. That is an awesome quality that we are seeing from the product teams at Microsoft.
Starting in Windows 10 1803, deprovisioned apps will NOT be reinstalled during a feature update. No more Solitaire returning from the dead every time we try to &amp;ldquo;Get current and stay current.</description></item><item><title>Intune/Autopilot Setup Companion Guide Part 1</title><link>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2019/12/18/autopilot-setup-part-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 14:50:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2019/12/18/autopilot-setup-part-1/</guid><description>Purpose The following blog posts will be a companion guide to Steve and Adam&amp;rsquo;s Intune training videos found at Intune.Training (this covers Episode 1 and 2) and will help you get Autopilot going in your environment.

I had the advantage of a dedicated class on network administration to build on, but not everyone had that opportunity. While this article focuses on a lab environment, most of the content will be applicable to real life as well.
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to include as many reference links as possible to help you learn about the concepts involved, but I cannot explain everything in one article.</description></item><item><title>How to use modules and package providers during OSD with MECM (SCCM/MEMCM)</title><link>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2019/12/12/how-to-use-modules-and-package-providers-during-osd-with-mecm-sccm-memcm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 15:53:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2019/12/12/how-to-use-modules-and-package-providers-during-osd-with-mecm-sccm-memcm/</guid><description>For the past few days, I&amp;rsquo;ve been implementing SnipeIT into our environment to start actually tracking assets as opposed to the archaic spreadsheet we had going. I wanted to add any new machine that were imaged into the database right away without any input from me. That way, all I had to do was assign a user to the device in the asset management portal for SnipeIT, and I was good to go.</description></item><item><title>Join The Squad</title><link>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/jointhesquad/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 01:18:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/jointhesquad/</guid><description>Join the Squad Fill out the form below and we will review and contact you to get you plugged into the Squad.
