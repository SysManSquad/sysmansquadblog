Here are some of the things you can do with it:
Query content objects which are distributed to distribution point(s) or distribution point group(s) Compare content objects distributed to distribution point(s) or distribution point group(s) Find content objects in a &amp;ldquo;distribution failed&amp;rdquo; state for all or selective distribution points Remove, distribute or redistribute content objects returned by any function to distribution point(s) Find an object in your site by searching on any arbitrary ID (useful when reading logs and want to know what object an ID resolves to) Migrate a distribution point&amp;rsquo;s content to a new/different distribution point by exporting its content library to prestaged .</description></item><item><title>Getting Reboot History and Optimizing Legacy Functions</title><link>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2020/08/28/getting-reboot-history-and-optimizing-legacy-functions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2020/08/28/getting-reboot-history-and-optimizing-legacy-functions/</guid><description>The other day, I logged on to a jump server and, while investigating an unrelated issue, I noticed the BG Info background showed the Last Reboot as March 1st, 2020. &amp;ldquo;That can&amp;rsquo;t be right,&amp;rdquo; I thought. &amp;ldquo;We have weekly maintenance windows to reboot these servers.&amp;rdquo;

The issue I was facing was that regular users do not have modify permissions to the public desktop on their corporate devices, meaning that the user is unable to remove annoying shortcuts that would get placed there by the various apps they install.

Proactive remediations are a pair of scripts used to detect and remediate a problem on a machine. The first script runs a query on your endpoints that returns an exit code of success or failure. We call this first script the detection script. On a successful exit code it is reported as &amp;ldquo;Without issue&amp;rdquo; in the Intune portal and nothing else is executed. On a failed exit code the second script is run which is called a remediation script.</description></item><item><title>Modern BIOS Management with the Administration Service</title><link>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2020/06/18/modern-bios-management-with-the-administration-service/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2020 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2020/06/18/modern-bios-management-with-the-administration-service/</guid><description>2021-04-27 update: The solution now works over CMG.
