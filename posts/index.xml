Microsoft Teams is working fine, then it&amp;rsquo;s not. What happened? I restarted Teams and it&amp;rsquo;s still acting weird.
Well, Teams is an interesting app when it comes to its cache. It relies heavily on it. I personally do not know all the ins and outs of the Teams cache, but I too know all too well that it is a pain in the butt when it goes awry.</description></item><item><title>Get rid of the ‚ÄúContinue connecting?‚Äù prompt for your policy-configured wifi networks</title><link>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2021/10/18/get-rid-of-the-continue-connecting-prompt-for-your-policy-configured-wifi-networks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 19:05:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2021/10/18/get-rid-of-the-continue-connecting-prompt-for-your-policy-configured-wifi-networks/</guid><description>As of Windows 11, we noticed that we were getting prompted to continue connecting to a network that we&amp;rsquo;d never had a problem with before. It&amp;rsquo;s already defined in group policy, so this new behavior is puzzling and annoying. The certificate in question is for the NPS/Radius server our network uses to validate credentials for the wifi.

I really had no idea how to even begin googling for this problem, but while talking to some of my fellow nerds on the Winadmins Discord server, tossing around some ideas on what could be causing this, looking to see whether there was a problem with the certificate, etc.</description></item><item><title>Removing The Built-in Teams App in Windows 11 with Intune</title><link>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2021/10/08/removing-the-built-in-teams-app-in-windows-11-with-intune/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 13:59:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2021/10/08/removing-the-built-in-teams-app-in-windows-11-with-intune/</guid><description>Intro So you&amp;rsquo;ve started rolling out Windows 11 to your endpoints, and your users got confused and upset over the consumer teams apps that is installed?

However there are issues if you plan on installing the CM client during Autopilot using the officially suggested methods
Mixing LOB and win32 applications will result in autopilot breaking, so you should use win32 apps exclusively, which somewhat contradicts the official way of installing the CM client with intune.</description></item><item><title>Use Azure Policy to configure Boot Diagnostics Settings</title><link>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2021/07/12/use-azure-policy-to-configure-boot-diagnostics-settings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 17:42:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2021/07/12/use-azure-policy-to-configure-boot-diagnostics-settings/</guid><description>I found several posts about configuring Diagnostic Settings on VMs, but none that specified or included boot diagnostics.

The purpose of this guide is to configure the collection of Logs in an Intune environment.

So I started looking for ways to identify Azure devices definitively and came across this Detect Windows Azure Virtual Machine post, which led to reading the Azure Metadata Service docs, and eventually got me to turn this into a Configuration Item / Configuration Baseline and subsequent Device Collections.</description></item><item><title>Automating Outside of Business Hours Responses</title><link>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2020/12/30/automating-changing-out-of-business-hours-responses/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 19:20:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2020/12/30/automating-changing-out-of-business-hours-responses/</guid><description>Have you ever had customers emailing in outside of hours?

Here are some of the things you can do with it:
Query content objects which are distributed to distribution point(s) or distribution point group(s) Compare content objects distributed to distribution point(s) or distribution point group(s) Find content objects in a &amp;ldquo;distribution failed&amp;rdquo; state for all or selective distribution points Remove, distribute or redistribute content objects returned by any function to distribution point(s) Find an object in your site by searching on any arbitrary ID (useful when reading logs and want to know what object an ID resolves to) Migrate a distribution point&amp;rsquo;s content to a new/different distribution point by exporting its content library to prestaged .</description></item><item><title>Getting Reboot History and Optimizing Legacy Functions</title><link>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2020/08/28/getting-reboot-history-and-optimizing-legacy-functions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2020/08/28/getting-reboot-history-and-optimizing-legacy-functions/</guid><description>The other day, I logged on to a jump server and, while investigating an unrelated issue, I noticed the BG Info background showed the Last Reboot as March 1st, 2020. &amp;ldquo;That can&amp;rsquo;t be right,&amp;rdquo; I thought. &amp;ldquo;We have weekly maintenance windows to reboot these servers.&amp;rdquo;

Proactive remediations are a pair of scripts used to detect and remediate a problem on a machine. The first script runs a query on your endpoints that returns an exit code of success or failure. We call this first script the detection script. On a successful exit code it is reported as &amp;ldquo;Without issue&amp;rdquo; in the Intune portal and nothing else is executed. On a failed exit code the second script is run which is called a remediation script.</description></item><item><title>Modern BIOS Management with the Administration Service</title><link>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2020/06/18/modern-bios-management-with-the-administration-service/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2020 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.sysmansquad.com/2020/06/18/modern-bios-management-with-the-administration-service/</guid><description>2021-04-27 update: The solution now works over CMG.
