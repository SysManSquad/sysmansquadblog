Administration, Curriculum and Technology have been working hard in school districts around the world to quickly train and support staff and faculty using systems they may never have heard of before this situation. It can also be difficult to communicate expectations and best practices with teachers as the companies themselves are making changes while we&rsquo;re actively using their products.</p><p>In addition, when the scope of the project continues to shift as we&rsquo;re building our airplane it can be hard to regain that focus on the overall situation. I took time this weekend to try and go over the recent changes and document how each different method of generating a Meet meeting link can interact with a student GSuite account.</p><p><div class=image><figure><a href=https://media.giphy.com/media/MO4XhoV27Imn6/giphy-downsized.gif target=_blank><img src=https://media.giphy.com/media/MO4XhoV27Imn6/giphy-downsized.gif alt="Likely reaction of many teachers as they read this post&amp;hellip;"></a></figure></div><em>Likely reaction of many teachers as they read this post&mldr;</em></p><p>My hope is this post can serve as a reference when working with Tech Directors, Curriculum Directors or Teachers to help them understand the situation through screenshots. I&rsquo;m also holding onto a slight hope that someone at Google will see this and find a way to protect &lsquo;blank, non-nicknamed or Calendar generated Meet meeting links&rsquo; in the same manner that they have for all &rsquo;nicknamed and Classroom-Meet integrated Meet meeting links&rsquo; which prevent students from joining a voice/video chat without a teacher present.</p><hr><h2 id=okay-im-intrigued-whats-the-deal>Okay, I&rsquo;m Intrigued, What&rsquo;s The Deal?</h2><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Teachers want the ability to engage their students in voice and video chat through Google Meet while under stay-at-home orders, but still want to keep their students protected from potential inappropriateness and cyber-bullying on school-approved systems while unsupervised.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Communicate to your teachers on how to properly share Google Meet meeting links and/or bug your Google representative and ask them to please protect all teacher generated Meet meeting links regardless of the method used to create the link.</p><hr><h2 id=just-email-the-teachers-whats-the-problem>Just Email The Teachers, What&rsquo;s The Problem?</h2><p>I serve as the Desktop Engineer for an organization that supports 7 different school districts through contract and each of those school districts have their own politics and communication plans. All of them have a Google presence, even if they primarily use Office 365 for their email system.</p><p>With this sudden shift to online learning the majority of our schools moved toward Google Classroom / Google Meet for all student-based interactions and that brought a whole lot more folks into using a tool that has been available for years, but rarely used by many depending on which school district you&rsquo;re working with.</p><p>In a general sense we&rsquo;ve had schools using Google Classroom for years and our Instructional Tech Coaches, Help Desk Technicians and Technical Support Specialists are all pretty comfortable being able to support Google Classroom, but we&rsquo;ve never had requests for Meet so it&rsquo;s been off in all the districts until now.</p><hr><h2 id=lets-do-our-due-diligence-and-set-up-google-meet-properly>Let&rsquo;s Do Our Due Diligence And Set Up Google Meet Properly</h2><p>As soon as Google Meet was requested and vetted - we enabled the service and read the Google recommendations for the &lsquo;<a href=https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9760270>Education IT administrator</a>&rsquo;:</p><p><a href=https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9760270><div class=image><figure><a href=00_Google_Support_Education_IT_Administrator.png target=_blank><img src=00_Google_Support_Education_IT_Administrator.png alt=screenshot></a></figure></div></a>Hey!

Students Can&rsquo;t Create Meet Meetings, What&rsquo;s The Concern?</h2><p>True, students cannot create Meet meetings now that we&rsquo;ve configured that setting. However, what about the links for Meet meetings that teachers share with students?</p><p>Below I&rsquo;m going to illustrate the issue as I understand it in the style of &ldquo;<a href=http://www.imanewbie.com/>ImaNewbie</a>&rdquo; comics of my Ultima Online youth and at the end of the article you&rsquo;ll have access to a PDF version of this illustration that you can feel free to use if you want. Here&rsquo;s the thing though &mldr; I&rsquo;m so nerdy to pull that UO reference out and yet understanding how Google Meet links interact with student accounts based on how it was created has confused ME! I feel bad for all those teachers out there.</p><hr><h2 id=first-a-bit-of-history>First A Bit Of History</h2><p><strong>March 19, 2020:</strong><br>Google gives us an update over at the <a href=https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2020/03/hangouts-meet-edu-updates.html>GSuite Update Blog</a> and they finally give us some educational protection on nicknamed meetings where participants (read: underage students) will not be able to re-join the meeting once the final participant has left. Prior to March 19th, students were able to re-join meetings without their teacher present.</p><p>This was welcome news, but should be read carefully because words matter.</p><p><a href=https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2020/03/hangouts-meet-edu-updates.html><div class=image><figure><a href=01_GSuite_Updates_Blog_March_19_01.png target=_blank><img src=01_GSuite_Updates_Blog_March_19_01.png alt=screenshot></a></figure></div></a></p><p>If we read a little further they clarify: &ldquo;<em>This means if the teacher is the last person to leave these types of meetings, students cannot join later without a teacher.</em>&rdquo;</p><p><a href=https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2020/03/hangouts-meet-edu-updates.html><div class=image><figure><a href=02_GSuite_Updates_Blof_March_19_02.png target=_blank><img src=02_GSuite_Updates_Blof_March_19_02.png alt=screenshot></a></figure></div></a></p><p><strong>April 19, 2020:</strong><br>Google gives another update over at the <a href=https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/meet-for-edu/>Education Outreach Blog</a> that they are integrating Meet inside Classroom with a nickname-like link with all the educational protections from March 19th.</p><p>Awesome!
