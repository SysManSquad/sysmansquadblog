The purpose of this guide is to configure the collection of Logs in an Intune environment. By default the log analytics you enable in Intune does not give you much information beyond auditing basic things. With this approach we can record any desired log for all of our machines. There is a companion video for this setup https://youtu.be/Uw3GjMnSXbI.
Enabling Log Analytics Navigate to endpoint.microsoft.com Select Reports Select Diagnostic Settings Select Add Diagnostic setting Select all options under Log Select Send to Log Analytics workspace Select a Log Analytics workspace You can archive to a storage account to keep data longer Now that we have the log analytics workspace configured we can configure the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA)</p></div></div></article><article class=list-item><div class=list-content><div class=post-header><h2><a href=https://sysmansquad.com/2020/12/16/mapping-network-drives-on-intune-devices/ class=post-title>Mapping Network Drives on Intune Devices</a></h2></div><div class=list-meta><span class=post-date>Wednesday, December 16, 2020</span></div><div class=post-entry><p>This guide is part of a video series companion guide on setting up mapped drives on Intune devices - you can watch the video here S02E18 How to Map Network Drives on Microsoft Intune Devices - (I.T)!

MSIX is a Windows app package format that provides a modern packaging experience to all Windows apps. The MSIX package format preserves the functionality of existing app packages and/or install files in addition to enabling new, modern packaging and deployment features to Win32, WPF, and Windows Forms apps.
Do you have a bloated application? Maybe one or two that are so old it doesn&rsquo;t even have any install parameters?</p></div></div></article><article class=list-item><div class=post-img><a href=https://sysmansquad.com/2020/08/24/bulk-updating-autopilot-enrolled-devices-with-graph-api-and-assigning-a-group-tag-based-on-purchase-orderid/><img width=520 height=400 src=https://sysmansquad.com/2020/08/24/bulk-updating-autopilot-enrolled-devices-with-graph-api-and-assigning-a-group-tag-based-on-purchase-orderid/msedge_qxJ7I3fI72.png></a></div><div class=list-content><div class=post-header><h2><a href=https://sysmansquad.com/2020/08/24/bulk-updating-autopilot-enrolled-devices-with-graph-api-and-assigning-a-group-tag-based-on-purchase-orderid/ class=post-title>Bulk Updating Autopilot enrolled devices with Graph API and assigning a Group Tag based on Purchase OrderID</a></h2></div><div class=list-meta><span class=post-date>Monday, August 24, 2020</span></div><div class=post-entry><p>The Problem For any new machines ordered from a vendor such as Dell that get enrolled into Autopilot you get the basic device info enrolled but nothing defining that would let it get auto-enrolled into a dynamic group easily.

Proactive remediations are a pair of scripts used to detect and remediate a problem on a machine. The first script runs a query on your endpoints that returns an exit code of success or failure. We call this first script the detection script. On a successful exit code it is reported as &ldquo;Without issue&rdquo; in the Intune portal and nothing else is executed. On a failed exit code the second script is run which is called a remediation script.</p></div></div></article><article class=list-item><div class=post-img><a href=https://sysmansquad.com/2020/05/26/arm-azure-resource-manager-templating-for-windows-virtual-desktop/><img width=520 height=400 src=https://sysmansquad.com/2020/05/26/arm-azure-resource-manager-templating-for-windows-virtual-desktop/msedge_CxaaJwZiAP.png></a></div><div class=list-content><div class=post-header><h2><a href=https://sysmansquad.com/2020/05/26/arm-azure-resource-manager-templating-for-windows-virtual-desktop/ class=post-title>ARM (Azure Resource Manager) Templating for Windows Virtual Desktop</a></h2></div><div class=list-meta><span class=post-date>Tuesday, May 26, 2020</span></div><div class=post-entry><p>Why would I use ARM templating, isn&rsquo;t the default Image Gallery fine? Well first off, what is ARM Templating? According to Microsoft &ldquo;You can automate deployments and use the practice of infrastructure as code. In code, you define the infrastructure that needs to be deployed. The infrastructure code becomes part of your project. Just like application code, you store the infrastructure code in a source repository and version it&mldr;&rdquo;
What does all that mean?</p></div></div></article><article class=list-item><div class=post-img><a href=https://sysmansquad.com/2021/01/27/intune-autopilot-setup-companion-guide-part-2-windows-store-for-business/><img width=520 height=400 src=https://sysmansquad.com/2021/01/27/intune-autopilot-setup-companion-guide-part-2-windows-store-for-business/msedge_Iausbx4qxD.png></a></div><div class=list-content><div class=post-header><h2><a href=https://sysmansquad.com/2021/01/27/intune-autopilot-setup-companion-guide-part-2-windows-store-for-business/ class=post-title>Intune/Autopilot Setup Companion Guide Part 2 – Windows Store for Business</a></h2></div><div class=list-meta><span class=post-date>Monday, January 27, 2020</span></div><div class=post-entry><p>Purpose The following blog posts will be a companion guide to Steve and Adam’s Intune training videos found at Intune.Training (this covers Episode 3) and will help you get the Windows Store for Business (WSfB, also known as Microsoft Store for Business) setup in your environment.
