Microsoft Teams is working fine, then it&amp;rsquo;s not. What happened? I restarted Teams and it&amp;rsquo;s still acting weird.
Well, Teams is an interesting app when it comes to its cache. It relies heavily on it.

Their users kept getting confused about what their passwords were, and it was causing a lot of HelpDesk tickets. Let&amp;rsquo;s find out what users have Microsoft accounts on the company domain so we can help move those accounts elsewhere to streamline the user experience.
