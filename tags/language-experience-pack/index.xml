Here I will show you how to use a PowerShell module I wrote, PSCMWin10Languages, to create Microsoft Endpoint Manager Configuration Manager Applications for each language you want to deploy via the Software Center.
These Applications are not for OSD. It changes the language only for the user who installs the Application via the Software Center.</description></item><item><title>Language Packs, Language Experience Packs, Language Interface Packsâ€¦ what?!</title><link>https://sysmansquad.com/2020/06/08/language-packs-language-experience-packs-language-interface-packs-what/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sysmansquad.com/2020/06/08/language-packs-language-experience-packs-language-interface-packs-what/</guid><description>For a while I have been curious on how to do Windows OSD with multiple languages &amp;ldquo;the proper way&amp;rdquo; using Configuration Manager. Whenever I have approached the subject I have always felt overwhelmed.
Googling the topic is just a hot mess. You&amp;rsquo;re faced with information that&amp;rsquo;s old, lacking real detail or generally misunderstood. My aim here is to demystify the topic and show you a solid way to do Windows 10 multi language OSD with ConfigMgr along with sound reasoning.</description></item></channel></rss>
