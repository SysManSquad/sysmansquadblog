Completely unrelated, an issue I was working on at a client was with their Autopilot setup left behind from an MS partner that was causing a forced reboot mid-ESP. Shortly after entering company credentials, there would be a 10 minute reboot warning and no way to cancel - other than Shift+F10 and running shutdown -a which a normal end user wouldn&rsquo;t know and shouldn&rsquo;t need to know.</p></div></div></article><article class=list-item><div class=list-content><div class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://sysmansquad.com/2023/03/28/adding-an-author/>How to add an author to SysManSquad</a></h2></div><div class=list-meta><span class=post-date>Tuesday, March 28, 2023
