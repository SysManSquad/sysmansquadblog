Hello!
Today I’d like to share with you a new solution I’ve developed to allow me to use the free Modern Driver Management solution from the team at MSEndpointMgr at my work. My goal is to use the process developed by them for managing drivers in a task sequence and convert it to use the ConfigMgr Administration Service since my company won&rsquo;t allow me to install their third-party web service.</p></div></div></article><article class=list-item><div class=list-content><div class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://sysmansquad.com/2020/04/26/sharing-google-meet-links-with-students-safely/>Sharing Google Meet Links With Students Safely Can Be Confusing For I.T.

Step 1 - Configure Teams You need to make sure your O365 Administrator has enabled Incoming webhooks connectors in your O365 Tenant.
Open Teams.
