Thankfully, commenter Anders Hannus has pointed out a policy module named TameMyCerts for Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS). This policy module, used in conjunction with the below scripts, will let us work around Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s changes and give us the added benefit of no longer needing name mappings that are insecure.</description></item></channel></rss>
