Been a while huh? Please explain this gap on your posting resume. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I&amp;rsquo;ve not been doing anything, it&amp;rsquo;s just that occasionally I forget that I should probably write about those things.
I&amp;rsquo;ve converted my home lab to Proxmox since Broadcom has been busy destroying everything I love (well, in the context of virtualization anyway) and I have not yet been desperate enough as to seriously consider Hyper-V for this scale (Anything more than 1 hyper-v host sucks to manage without installing SCVMM and SCVMM doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense for 3 very small hypervisors - too much ram dedicated to allowing vmm to run).</description></item></channel></rss>
