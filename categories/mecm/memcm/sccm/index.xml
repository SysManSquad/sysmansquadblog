This is a long and overdue update on a solution I started working on last year to allow my organization to use the modern driver management solution without the need of the custom webservice. I also wanted the solution to use the built-in task sequence steps as much as possible to allow other administrators to customize the solution to their need without the need to go modify a big PowerShell script.</description></item><item><title>Create a new WinPE boot image</title><link>https://sysmansquad.com/2021/02/22/create-a-new-winpe-boot-image/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 09:51:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sysmansquad.com/2021/02/22/create-a-new-winpe-boot-image/</guid><description>Introduction In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you can create a new boot image in ConfigMgr.

Getting content distributed is one thing, but then making sure it STAYS distributed, and old things are getting cleaned up, and making sure all the content hashes are correct, etc. It’s easy to feel like you’re constantly drowning in a sea of DP warnings and errors.
Luckily, there’s some simple things we can do to take this burden away.</description></item><item><title>Multilingual Windows 10 20H2 OSD with ConfigMgr</title><link>https://sysmansquad.com/2021/02/16/multilingual-windows-10-20h2-osd-with-configmgr/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 10:06:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sysmansquad.com/2021/02/16/multilingual-windows-10-20h2-osd-with-configmgr/</guid><description>Introduction In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to share with you a task sequence for ConfigMgr / SCCM / MEMCM / MECM / MCM (this is just getting silly now) that localises Windows 10 to a language other than the default language of the OS install media.

I&amp;rsquo;m sure someone was not happy about the overall user experience. In particular when the Teams Machine Wide installer is finished, and detected by your application management tool of choice it does&amp;hellip; nothing. The user is left with a message claiming Teams is &amp;lsquo;Installed&amp;rsquo; when clearly it is not.</description></item><item><title>Collecting Logs with Log Analytics for Intune devices</title><link>https://sysmansquad.com/2021/01/18/collecting-logs-with-log-analytics-for-intune-devices/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2021 17:38:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sysmansquad.com/2021/01/18/collecting-logs-with-log-analytics-for-intune-devices/</guid><description>Why do I need logs? The purpose of this guide is to configure the collection of Logs in an Intune environment.

Currently, they had a naming convention being used (well, supposed to be used) to simply prefix the hostname with AZ-, but they came across a couple Domain Controllers that hadn&amp;rsquo;t installed Updates in 7+ months, and of course the names didn&amp;rsquo;t follow the accepted standard.
So I started looking for ways to identify Azure devices definitively and came across this Detect Windows Azure Virtual Machine post, which led to reading the Azure Metadata Service docs, and eventually got me to turn this into a Configuration Item / Configuration Baseline and subsequent Device Collections.</description></item><item><title>Give your ADR a little boost with Status Filter Rules and PowerShell</title><link>https://sysmansquad.com/2020/12/08/give-your-adr-a-little-boost-with-status-filter-rules-and-powershell/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 09:16:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sysmansquad.com/2020/12/08/give-your-adr-a-little-boost-with-status-filter-rules-and-powershell/</guid><description>Introduction MEMCM already offers a lot of features to help SysAdmins automate many processes and save them a lot of time to drink more coffee☕ work on less mundane and more interesting tasks.
